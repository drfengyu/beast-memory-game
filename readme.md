## Game Concept

**BeastMemory** is a memory card game designed to effectively enhance memory skills. It meticulously combines captivating animal artwork with gameplay intricacies to ensure a delightful and mentally stimulating experience.

### üÉè Gameplay

Players embark on a quest to match pairs of cards, with the game‚Äôs complexity adjustable by varying the number of card pairs.

### üé® Aesthetic Appeal

Utmost importance is placed on vibrant and appealing animal arts, ensuring sustained user engagement and enjoyment.

### üìä Feedback and Encouragement

Post-game, players receive timely feedback, including the time taken to complete a level and an uplifting message if their performance improves. This immediate response fuels motivation and the ambition to advance.

### üìà Performance Monitoring

Attention is also given to track the excess openings made by a user, indicating cards that have been previously revealed, aiding in self-assessment and improvement. However, maintaining a positive and encouraging environment is paramount. Thus, only the time taken is displayed in cases of lesser performance, avoiding any discouragement or negative feedback.

Through these thoughtfully implemented features and mechanisms, **BeastMemory** stands as a cherished tool for augmenting memory, while assuring an entertaining and positive gaming encounter.
