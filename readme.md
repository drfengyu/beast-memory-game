## TODO

- [ ] Create game GUI prototype
- [ ] Add game config
- [ ] Add telegram theme support. Not sure if better to use css vars or data from https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#themeparams . Not sure if data is always available. Also, better to have some theme if app open by link (not in webapp context)
- [ ] Use cloud storage and save user statistic here
- [ ] Explore methods to increase difficulty levels
- [ ] Add new high quality assets
- [ ] Make responsive design for game field
- [ ] Make better card design
- [ ] Add menu button that opens popup with statistic, setting and etc
