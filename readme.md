## Game Concept

The Memory Card Game is a top-notch tool designed to enhance memory retention. It's a recommended tool for both children and adults, especially those recovering from cognitive impairments such as post-stroke conditions. We realized the gap in the market for a simple, free application of this nature, which inspired us to create this game for the Telegram contest.

**Key Features:**

1. **Daily Trainer:** Designed to be a daily cognitive exercise, the game gradually increases in complexity to challenge and improve your memory.
2. **Progressive Levels:** Start at a beginner's level with 6 cards, and watch the number of cards increase as you advance through the game.
3. **Performance Tracking:** Our game keeps track of your performance statistics, allowing users to monitor and witness their improvement over time.

## Technology Stack

During the development of **BeastMemory**, we adhered to the following principles:

- **Developer-Friendly**: The development process should be convenient and understandable for most developers.
- **Easy Auto-Deploy**: Application should auto-deploy on push, without additional setup.
- **Fast Loading**: The application should load as quickly as possible to enhance the user experience.

### Framework: Preact

Given these principles, we chose [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) as the main framework for its notable advantages:

- **Small Size**: Ensures fast application loading and quick browser parsing.
- **Reactive System**: Allows easy description of complex interactions.
- **Similarity to React**: Familiarity for most developers as React is an industry standard.
- **Fast Rebuilding with Vite**: Practically instantaneous, enhancing developer experience.

### Deployment: GitHub Pages

For deployment, we selected [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) since our game does not require server interactions. GitHub Pages offers us:

- **Effortless Deployment**: Avoid the hassle of VPS rental and HTTPS certificate setup.
- **Automatic Deployment**: On repository push, thanks to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), keeping the game updated is seamless.

The deployment script can be found [here](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

By choosing these technologies and platforms, we ensure an efficient, enjoyable, and productive development and gaming experience with **BeastMemory**.
