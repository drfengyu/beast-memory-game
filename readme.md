## The Road to Creation

### Introduction

It's always been a challenge for me to see things through. Like many developers, I'd get excited about an idea, create a prototype, and then my attention would wane. There were so many projects that felt pointless. However, everything shifted when my wife suffered a stroke. This period was tough, and we worked tirelessly to recover her memory. The most helpful exercise was matching paired cards. I realized most apps out there were overly complicated when we just needed something straightforward. So, when Vlad shared information about the competition, I knew this was my calling.

### Prototype and Hurdles

Building a prototype was straightforward ‚Äì after all, I was a web developer. But design? That was another story. My wife adores bright colors, and I wanted to craft something special for her. I had no artist contacts, and hiring a professional would cost a fortune, not to mention the uncertainty of tight deadlines. Doubts about the project's viability began to cloud my mind.

### Light at the End of the Tunnel

Recalling my previous unsuccessful attempt at using neural networks for game sprites, I decided to give them another shot. After all, creating static arts is much simpler than animations. Initial attempts were flawed: the arts generated were stylistically inconsistent, leading to on-screen chaos. While individual pieces looked great, they didn‚Äôt gel together. After much trial and error, it felt like achieving a cohesive style was an elusive dream. However, I eventually managed to pin down a consistent style. The breakthrough was achieved! More details on the process can be found in the generation section.

### The Final Push

Even with the arts ready and the prototype functioning, the daunting task of refinement lay ahead. This phase has always been my Achilles' heel. This is when Vlad became my anchor. He tested, gathered feedback, suggested improvements, and simply stood by my side. Thanks to his assistance, we concluded the project, leaving a couple of brilliant ideas for the future while concentrating on meticulous testing of what was already crafted.

### Deployment: GitHub Pages

For deployment, we selected [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) since our game does not require server interactions. GitHub Pages offers us:

- **Effortless Deployment**: Avoid the hassle of VPS rental and HTTPS certificate setup.
- **Automatic Deployment**: On repository push, thanks to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), keeping the game updated is seamless.

The deployment script can be found [here](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

By choosing these technologies and platforms, we ensure an efficient, enjoyable, and productive development and gaming experience with **BeastMemory**.

## Dive into Project Details

### Let's Get Started: Simple Steps

If you're just diving in, here‚Äôs the quick path:

1. **Understand the Game Mechanics**: Start with [`GameStateService`](src/services/game-state.service.ts).
2. **See the Game**: Jump to [`GameFieldComponent`](src/components/game-field/game-field.tsx) and see how it comes alive.
3. **Explore Individual Elements**: Visit [`GameCardComponent`](src/components/game-field/game-card/game-card.tsx) to understand how each card flips and interacts.

### Services

Now, let's peel back the layers and see what makes our game tick in the background:

- **[`GameStateService`](src/services/game-state.service.ts)**: The maestro of our game, orchestrating everything that happens, from the shuffle of the cards to what happens when a pair is matched.
- **[`StatisticService`](src/services/statistic.service.ts)**: This service acts as the game's memory, storing data from previous games and calculating average statistics for overall performance.
- **[`ThemeService`](src/services/theme.service.ts)**: This service helps switch themes. It keeps the current theme's details and sets the right CSS for the whole game, making sure it looks good.

### Components

And now, let's have a closer look at our game's visible parts:

- **[`GameFieldComponent`](src/components/game-field/game-field.tsx)**: This component manages the main game layout. It organizes and adjusts the game field to display all cards optimally based on screen size.
- **[`GameCardComponent`](src/components/game-field/game-card/game-card.tsx)**: Represents an individual game card. Handles card flipping animation and displays the card's front and back designs.
- **[`GameOverComponent`](src/components/game-over/game-over.tsx)**: Displayed after the game ends. It presents the end-of-game statistics.
- **[`StatisticComponent`](src/components/statistic/statistic.tsx)**: Provides an overview of previous game results and displays average gameplay statistics.

## Creating Art with Midjonery

## Feedback on Developing Telegram's WebApp

### What We Appreciated

- Telegram's client uses modern webViews, which lets developers use the newest JS features without worries about compatibility.
- The "@twa-dev/types" package is very useful. It gives types for WebApp features and acts like a guide or reference.
- The WebApp API is easy to understand and use.
- The Telegram beta version has dev tools, making it easier to find and fix problems.
- Working with the WebApp was free of big problems. It felt like building a regular web site.

### Challenges Encountered

- We had some issues with cloud storage speed in the Telegram beta for macOS.
- Changing the style of the main and back buttons mainly uses JS, so we couldn't fully use CSS variables for theming
- The main button doesn't know HEX8 colors. We had to think of other ways to choose colors.
- To make sure everything works, we checked our designs in Safari. Looks like the macOS Telegram client uses Safari's engine.
- From tests with friends, we found that the Haptic Feedback doesn't always work. Some said they didn't feel any vibration.
- For some reason, web apps are not working at all on the Telegram client for Ubuntu.
